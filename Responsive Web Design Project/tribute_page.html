            <h2>Timeline of Steve Jobs's life:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>February 24, 1955</strong> - Steven Paul Jobs is born in San Francisco to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali. 
                    The then-unmarried couple give up their son to adoption. Paul and Clara Jobs become Jobs' non-biological parents.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1968</strong> - Jobs calls Bill Hewlett, the co-founder and co-namesake of Hewlett-Packard, looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter.
                    Hewlett gives Jobs the parts, as well as an internship with the company that summer.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1970</strong> - Meets future Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak through a friend.
                    In Wozniak's 2006 autobiography, "iWoz," he notes that the two "hit it off" immediately, despite their four-year age difference.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1974</strong> - Begins a brief stint as an engineer at Atari. 
                    Working the night shift, he employs Wozniak to help whittle down the hardware required for a prototype of a single-player version of Pong, 
                    the game that would go on to become Breakout. Jobs leaves Atari in the summer to travel through India, only to return to California to live in a commune.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1976</strong> - Co-founds Apple Computer with Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. That same year, the company sells the Apple I in the form of a kit that sells for $666.66.</li>
